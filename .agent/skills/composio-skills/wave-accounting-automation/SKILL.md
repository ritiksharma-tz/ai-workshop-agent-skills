# Wave Accounting Automation

> **Note:** The Wave Accounting toolkit (`wave_accounting`) does not currently have native tools available in the Composio platform. Searches for Wave Accounting-specific tools return results from other accounting/invoicing platforms (Stripe, Zoho Invoice) instead.

**Toolkit docs:** [composio.dev/toolkits/wave_accounting](https://composio.dev/toolkits/wave_accounting)

## Status

This integration is **not yet available** with native Wave Accounting tools. When Wave Accounting tools become available in Composio, this skill file will be updated with real tool slugs, workflows, and pitfalls.

For accounting and invoicing automation needs, consider these alternatives that are available today:
- **Stripe** -- Payment processing, invoicing, and subscription management
- **Zoho Invoice** -- Invoice creation, payment tracking, and contact management
- **QuickBooks** -- Full accounting suite with invoicing and expense tracking
- **FreshBooks** -- Cloud accounting with time tracking and invoicing

---

## Setup

1. Add the Composio MCP server to your client configuration:
   ```
   https://rube.app/mcp
   ```
2. Check back for Wave Accounting integration availability.
