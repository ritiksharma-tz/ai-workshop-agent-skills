# README.md Reference Structure

A well-structured README should cover these sections (adapt based on project type):

## Essential Sections

1. **Title + one-line description** — what it is
2. **Contents** — table of contents for navigation
3. **Overview** — human-centric description of what and why
4. **Key Features** — bullet list of capabilities
5. **Technology Stack** — table of layer → tools
6. **Quick Start (TL;DR)** — minimal steps to get running
7. **Prerequisites** — required tools with versions
8. **Installation & Setup** — detailed setup instructions
9. **Environment Variables** — all config vars with purpose and defaults
10. **Running the Service** — dev and prod commands

## Recommended Sections (if applicable)

11. **Database & Migrations** — schema management commands
12. **Docker Workflows** — build, run, compose commands
13. **API Documentation** — endpoints table with methods, paths, params, body schemas
14. **Project Structure** — tree view of key directories
15. **Architecture / Agent / Pipeline Overview** — high-level flow description
16. **Dependency Highlights** — key libraries and their roles
17. **Operational Cheat Sheet** — common tasks → commands table

## Guidelines

- Every command in Quick Start must be runnable
- Environment variables should include defaults and notes
- API endpoint tables should include query params and body schemas
- Project structure should show 2 levels of depth with brief annotations
- Link to per-service/module documentation where applicable
